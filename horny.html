         and together let's get to know the team members.</p>
    <h2><u>karim</u> </h2>
    <p>
        He is the first captain of the team. The best player in history for him is Ronaldo.
         He is the man of difficult tasks in the team and also the decisive man.

    <h2>
       <u>ahmed taher</u> 
    </h2>
    <p><em> Ahmed Taher</em> is one of the best players in the team,
         and the most important thing that distinguishes him is his high ability to dodge. 
        He can make you behind him in a blink of an eye, and he can control the ball in a wonderful way,
         and the same is Alexis Sanchez.

    <h2><u>youssef</u></h2>
    <p>
        Youssef Ahmed is one of the best goalkeepers in the world. He is characterized by a very fast reaction. 
         He is good at playing as a <mark>center back</mark>, and in many situations he carries the team on his shoulders.

    <h2><u>Hamo yahia</u></h2>
    <P>
        Mohamed Yahya is one of the best defenders in the world and the best defender
         who played next to me is the safety valve for the team.
         He never gets tired of cutting balls. 
        He can play the role of goalkeeper without using his arms.
